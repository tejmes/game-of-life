# Game of Life
Implementation of Conway’s Game of Life in C# (.NET 8, WinForms)

## Description
This project simulates the **Game of Life** – a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway.
The application allows you to run the simulation, pause it, step through generations, and adjust various parameters of both the display and the world itself.

The simulation logic is separated from the user interface, making it easy to extend functionality or change the UI.

## Features
- Start, pause and step through the simulation
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Displays current generation and number of alive cells
- Zooming and panning with the mouse
- Customize appearance (cell, grid, background colors)
- World resizing
- Random fill with configurable density and custom seeds
- Toggle wrapped edges (infinite world effect)
- Import and export state (JSON, PNG)
